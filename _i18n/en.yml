method:
  p1: |-
    The child occupies a central position and, in its uniqueness, is a bearer of strong potential.
    The adult's job is to offer adequate spaces for the expression of intuition and imagination.
    Children learn within the relationship between peers and with the adult who stands in a perspective of listening and observation.
    The nursery school must be thought of as a place to build the right conditions for learning, within which children can be
    welcomed and helped to grow.
  p2: |-
    "The child is like a traveler who observes new things and tries to understand the unknown language of those around him. We adults are the guides of these travelers who make their entry into human life..."

  p3: |-
    The child must have the opportunity to express his full potential within a well-organized environment and detailed planning.
    The better the quality of the gaming opportunities offered, the more enjoyable the experience will be for both the adult and the child.
  p4: |-
    Within the nursery school, the child must create secure and stable relationships with a figure of
    reference that takes care of him.
    The good numerical ratio between educators and children is the key element that guarantees
    the quality of a nursery school, the organization of the school ensures regular occasions for care
    in which the educator pays personal attention to each individual child.
  p5: |-
    An American research has shown that children included in nursery programs with more careful educators
    have a better linguistic and cognitive development and
    they have a better social life. The organization in sections allows the educator
    to be careful to the playing opportunities appropriate for their age.
  p6: |-
    The section for younger children combines intimacy and spaciousness, to allow children who already move to use
    a suitable surface and to guarantee to the little ones a comfortable space where to play and rest.
    In the first year of life the child understands the world through his senses, so it will be important to help him in the development
    of motility and ability to manipulate, to make him an active subject in the understanding of the world.

workshops:
  p1: "From Monday to Friday there are <strong>two structured workshops per day</strong>. Structured laboratories are all those activities that are coordinated by an adult who explains to the children the activity they are going to do together."
  p2: "Each laboratory is designed as a game that allows learning by letting the child experience freedom and autonomy. Here is a list of the main structured laboratories:"
  manipolazione:
    title: "Manipulation Laboratory"
    text: "Using pongo, salt dough. The manipulation activity responds to many children's needs, stimulates his creativity, develops sensory, motor, cognitive and expressive skills, promotes eye-hand coordination and develops fine manual skills."
  travasi:
    title: "Decanting Laboratory"
    text: "A wide range of containers of different shapes and materials to be filled and emptied with different types of pasta, legumes and rice."
  puzzle:
    title: "Cognitive Laboratory"
    text: "Cognitive games allow the child to stimulate assertive and mnemonic abilities. For this purpose we use puzzles, objects joining and images of everyday life to do games of image association."
  libri:
    title: "Book Reading"
    text: "Telling fairy tales and letting children interpret the different characters that populate books allow the child to develop imagination."
  teatrino:
    title: "The \"Theater\""
    text: "Educators perform the most beautiful fairy tales through the use of puppets and the little theater. This is an important moment of exchange between adult and child who actively participates in the construction of the story."
  pittura:

    text: "Using the brush or finger painting."
  creativo:
    title: "Creative Laboratory"

  cucina:

  psicomotricita:
    title: "Psychomotricity"
    text: "Once a week there is a psychomotricity laboratory which can be performed outdoor (in the garden) or in the classroom. Knowing how to move in space and knowing your possibilities is a fundamental objective for this age group. Children in small groups can try different psychomotricity paths based on their acquired skills."
  musica:
    title: "Music Laboratory"
    text: "Music, like all artistic disciplines, is an expressive language that, especially in the first years of life, reaches the essence of the child even before verbal language. For this reason, as early as infancy, we have the opportunity to interact with the child through music that is truly conceived as an opportunity for emotional, physical (gestural) and social growth."
  lingue:
    title: "English and Spanish Laboratory"
    text: "The child from 1 to 3 years is still in the phase of learning his primary language and for this reason his brain has a remarkable elasticity. If the child already comes into contact with a foreign language and starts playing with it, he will have the opportunity to learn the differences between the sounds of the two languages in a spontaneous and natural way, all at an age when nothing is experienced as a task but as pure fun."
  esterni:
    title: "Outdoor Activities"
    text: "The structure is equipped with a very spacious outdoor garden (150 square meters), which offers the possibility of doing several external laboratories including gardening, water games and the use of small swimming pools in summer for bathing."

inclusion:
  p1: The adaptation phase is a particularly delicate period. The child arrives in an environment that he does not know and is expected to relate to
    unknown adults and children. For this reason it is important that the adaptation phase is gradual and serene.
  p2: During the first days the parent will be required to accompany the child in the class in which the other children and the educator of reference are present. The child will thus be able to get to know the surrounding environment and the educator can always count on parent's presence in times of stress. The parent and the child are bound by an invisible thread which is one of the manifestations of the attachment bond. Gradually the child and educator will establish a bond of trust and affection and the parent can be every day less present.
  p3: It's important that the educator and the parent talk about what is happening to give a meaning to the child's practical experience. The more the adult is serene and shows trust in the environment and in the educator, the more the child will feel that he is in a safe place.
  p4: Another fundamental thing is to say goodbye the child at the time of leaving and to verbalize that the mother and father go to work but they will return back to take him home. The child must feel clarity and serenity in the message that the adult sends. Our model of adaptation ends in about two weeks. It is very important not to force the children and respect their pace.
  p5: The child can bring a teddy bear or a game to which he is particularly attached, it acts as a "transitional object" and creates a sort of bridge between the nursery school and the house, having the function of comforting the child in times of stress.

day:
  t1: 7.30 - 9.30 Welcoming
  p1: Welcoming means to meet, listen, reassure, contain and verbalize emotions. In the delicate moment of entrance, we try to offer understanding and support to both mother and child, obviously in different forms. It is impossible to welcome a child without welcoming his parents, his family and his story. Children are welcomed at the entrance by the educator, in the lobby there are holes to leave the child's personal items and a small box in which to put the shoes before wearing non-slip socks or slippers for the nursery school.
  t2: 9.30 - 10.00 Snack
  p2: For the time of the snack we move into the big hall. The younger children are taken by the educators while the older ones eat autonomously. Snacks are provided by the nursery school.
  t3: 10.00 - 11.00 Activities and Laboratories
  p3: |-
    Every day the spaces of the nursery school are purposely arranged to allow all children to freely choose what, where and how to play with whom. The spaces are communicating and an educator is always present in every room.

    These are the moments of playing, prepared by educators according to certain criteria:
  i1: "Variety: during the year various materials and games are proposed;"
  i2: "Congruence with age and progression: the materials and activities follow a logic of increasing complexity, in relation to the development of children;"
  i3: "Regularity: all moments of activity are made recognizable to the child because they are proposed consistently;"
  i4: "Social interactivity: in relation to the skills of each age, all activities aim to facilitate communication and exchanges between peers."
  t4: 11.00 - 11.20 Changing
  p4: This moment is dedicated to body care. Each child is accompanied to the bathroom individually to encourage all that variety of attitudes and attentions that he needs in this delicate and pleasant moment.
  p4-2: In fact, we believe that the tone of voice, the way the child is supported on the changing table, the gestures and looks that are exchanged during the "change" are crucial to establishing a climate of trust, complicity and affection between the two.
  t5: 11.30 - 12.00 Lunch
  p5: "Lunch is the time for socializing for children. This moment is made more fun by the figure of the \"waiter\": every day two children are chosen on a rotating basis and they'll bring the dishes to the other children who are waiting on the table."
  p5-2: The role of the waiter allows the children to actively participate in the meal and helps to create a serene atmosphere.
  t6: 12.30 - 14.30 Sleeping
  p6: The children who stay at the nursery school to sleep are accompanied by the educators in the sleeping room. Before going to sleep, the educator sings some songs or read a fable to reconcile the moment of sleep, then children go to sleep all together. Each child has his own fixed place and easily recognizes it also because of the sheet that is brought from home.
  t7: 15.30 - 16.00 Afternoon snack
  t8: 15.30-18.30 Afternoon activities
  p8: Free playing activities, out in the garden when possible. Reading and cognitive games.
  t9: Reunion
  p9: The exit times are 15.30, 16.30, 17.30, 18.30. For children who do not sleep in the nursery school, the first exit time is at 12.30.
